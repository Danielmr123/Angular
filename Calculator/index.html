        The first solid state electronic calculator was created in the 1960s, building on the extensive history of tools such as the abacus (developed around 2000 BC), and the mechanical calculator (developed in the 17th century AD). It was developed in parallel with the analog computers of the day.

        The pocket sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the first microprocessor developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom (Which was Intel's first microprocessor). They later became commonly used within the Oil and Gas industry.

        Modern electronic calculators vary: from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s (as integrated circuits made their size and cost small). By the end of that decade, calculator prices had reduced to a point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

        Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all PDA-type devices (save a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices).

        In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets; for example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space. Currently, basic calculators are inexpensive, but the scientific and graphing models tend to be higher priced.

            <p> 3 Reasons to Teach Calculator Skills to Upper Elementary Students
                So why should we teach upper elementary students how to use a calculator? Based on my own experiences and feedback from other teachers, I am convinced that calculators boost mathematical thinking and are motivating to students. Here are 6 reasons to teach calculator skills and to encourage your students to use them to solve math problems.
                </p>
                <p>1. Calculators help kids overcome computational limitations.
                Kids often have the conceptual understanding to solve problems that are much more difficult than their computational ability would allow. For example, a student might know they need to divide a 2-digit number by another 2-digit number, but if he or she hasn't mastered this skill, the answer will be out of reach without a calculator.
                Overcoming computational limitations is especially helpful for special needs students and actually removes barriers to more advanced levels of math instruction.
                </p>
                <p>2. Calculators encourage the use of multiple strategies.
                Being able to use a calculator frees students to consider and test out a wide variety of problem solving strategies in a short time. They can solve a problem using one strategy (without or without a calculator), and check their answers using a different strategy.
                </p> 
                <p>3. Calculators help kids solve more problems in less time.
                Calculators allow students to work more quickly, which means they can solve more problems in a given time. So you can increase the number and complexity of the problems you introduce in each lesson without increasing the time devoted to problem solving lessons.

             ng-if="!isSmall && !isSmall1"> <!-- NOT WORKING?!?! -->

             <div ng-if="!isSmall2">
                <h1>Future</h1>
                    <p>Future of the calculator</p>                
            </div>
            <div ng-if="isSmall2"> 

            <p> There’s no letting up.  If time is going to advance to 100 years from now, the calculator is going to walk with it without ceasing to undergo regular improvements along the way.  Give the credit to those who tinker with unthinkable ideas about the future of calculators.
Voice-operated
At the moment, the computer lacks HD and user-friendly features.  The masters of Science and Technology are looking at calculators that can be activated and operated by voice.  Someday, there will be no more fingers that stumble over tiny number and function keys.  With voice operations, every calculation will be precise and done in no time.
Advanced Networking System
Tomorrow’s calculators will be wired, but with far more advanced functionality for the wiring.  They will be wired for information sharing, much like the idea of a professor sharing the answer with his students through his calculator.  The teacher has the option of linear sharing, that is to share information with one student only, or multi-point sharing, where one receives what his classmates receive.  The sharing function is to be turned off during exams to discourage cheating.  Wi-Fi connection service will be enhanced to serve this purpose.</p>
